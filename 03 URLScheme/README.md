#  URLScheme

This app demonstrates handling a custom URL scheme via SwiftUI. Since the convention for custom URL schemes is to use the app's bundle identifier as the scheme, you will see that the that is used explicitly in this example.

Try running the app, then opening Safari on the simulator and navigating to `org.groton.swift-examples.URLScheme://this.is/a/test?foo=bar&baz=123`
