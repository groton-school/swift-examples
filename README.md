## Troubleshooting

### `bundle install` fails

If you are using the macOS default install of Ruby, things may not work early on. Go ahead and install the Homebrew version of `rbenv` instead. `rbenv` lets you install and work with different versions of Ruby transparently.

```sh
brew install rbenv
```

Cocoapods blithely suggests that you install it using `sudo`. This is a terrible suggestion -- you don't want to install software as root! Instead, use `rbenv` to install the required version of ruby, and then try running the Bundler again:

```sh
cd path/to/project/directory
cat .ruby-version | rbenv install
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.zprofile
source ~/.zprofile
bundle install
```

The above will: 

1. Install the version of Ruby specified in the `.ruby-version` file in the project.
2. Add the `rbenv` initializer to your login profile
3. Reload your login profile to initialize `rbenv`
4. Re-run `bundle install`, this time using the correct version of Ruby and the Bundler

### Build fails

```
    SDK does not contain 'libarclite' at the path '/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/lib/arc/libarclite_iphonesimulator.a'; try increasing the minimum deployment target
```

1. In the `Pods` Project, in the `Keys-framework` target, under `Build Settings`, set `iOS Deployment Target` to `17.0` (the default value of `8.0` is not recent enough -- it needs to be _at least_ `12.0`)
2. In the `Secrets` Project, in the `Secrets` target, under `Build Settings`, set `User Script Sandboxing` to `No` (The obfusticated code generated by `cocoapods-keys` seems not to be generated properly in sandboxed mode -- which underscores that it is an abandoned and outdated project... but has no real replacement.)
