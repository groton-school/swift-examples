## Troubleshooting

### `bundle install` fails

If you are using the macOS default install of Ruby, things may not work early on. Go ahead and install the Homebrew version of Ruby instead.

```sh
brew install ruby
```

Cocoapods blithely suggests that you install it using `sudo`. This is a terrible suggestion -- you don't want to install software as root! Instead, fix the permissions that are blocking it.

``` sh
ls -hal /opt/homebrew/lib/ruby
```

This will give you a directory listing of the Homebrew Ruby install:

```
total 0
drwxr-xr-x    5 sbattis  admin   160B Mar 20 15:27 .
drwxrwxr-x  528 sbattis  admin    17K Mar 18 08:21 ..
drwxr-xr-x    3 sbattis  admin    96B Feb 22 10:43 gems
drwxr-xr-x@   3 sbattis  admin    96B Mar 19 14:23 site_ruby
drwxr-xr-x    3 sbattis  admin    96B Mar 20 15:27 vendor_ruby
```

The user (`sbattis`) and group (`admin`) are listed next to each subdirectory. The core problem is that somewhere in `gems`, a directory is owned by `root`, when it should be owned by _you_. Fix it (user your username in place of mine)!

```bash
sudo chown -R sbattis /opt/homebrew/lib/ruby/gems
```

### Build fails

```
    SDK does not contain 'libarclite' at the path '/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/lib/arc/libarclite_iphonesimulator.a'; try increasing the minimum deployment target
```

1. In the `Pods` Project, in the `Keys-framework` target, under `Build Settings`, set `iOS Deployment Target` to `17.0` (the default value of `8.0` is not recent enough -- it needs to be _at least_ `12.0`)
2. In the `Secrets` Project, in the `Secrets` target, under `Build Settings`, set `User Script Sandboxing` to `No` (The obfusticated code generated by `cocoapods-keys` seems not to be generated properly in sandboxed mode -- which underscores that it is an abandoned and outdated project... but has no real replacement.)
